# NestJS-DDD-CQRS-Example

This project is a modern, scalable, and maintainable web application built using NestJS and TypeORM, following Domain-Driven Design (DDD) principles and the Command Query Responsibility Segregation (CQRS) pattern.

## Description

This application is designed to provide a solid foundation for building complex and scalable web applications. By leveraging the power of NestJS, TypeORM, DDD, and CQRS, this project ensures clean architecture, separation of concerns, and a robust and maintainable codebase.

## Features:

NestJS as the application framework, providing a modular and testable structure
TypeORM for seamless database integration and easy management of database entities and migrations
Domain-Driven Design (DDD) to ensure a clean separation between business logic, application logic, and infrastructure code
Command Query Responsibility Segregation (CQRS) pattern to separate read and write operations, enabling independent scalability and optimization
Comprehensive unit and integration testing for maximum code quality and stability
Detailed documentation and examples to guide developers through the application's architecture and implementation
By using this project as a starting point, developers can quickly build and deploy highly-scalable and maintainable web applications that adhere to industry best practices and design patterns.

## Getting Started

Please follow the steps in the documentation to set up the development environment, configure the application, and learn more about the project structure and implementation details.

### Installation
```bash
$ yarn install
```

## Running the app
```bash
$ docker compose up -d
$ yarn start:dev or yarn start
```

We hope you find this project valuable in kickstarting your next NestJS/TypeORM application with DDD and CQRS. Happy coding!
